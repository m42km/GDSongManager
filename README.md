# GDSongManager
Install songs into Geometry Dash easily. Built in C++ and packaged with [Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php)

## Software Installation Guide
**Recommended installation** - Download the Inno Setup installer @ the latest release and run it. If your antivirus conflicts with your installation then make an exception for the installer executable, after that make an exception for `songinst.exe` in the directory that you installed it in as well.

**Manual installation** -  Follow these steps:


## NONG Installation

Click on a NONG and let GDSM do its magic. The window will close after a couple of seconds, after that just exit out of and go back in the level. If it doesn't show up then restart Geometry Dash if needed. If it still doesn't work then [open an issue here](https://github.com/m42km/GDSongManager/issues) with the name of your operating system.

## Making a NONG compatible with GDSM

Make sure that you have "File name extensions" visible in File Explorer (This is what it should look like in Windows 11):

Ensure that the song is converted to the mp3 format, then rename the filename extension from `.mp3` to `.gdsong`. 

*Examples of valid GDSM filenames:*

```458.gdsong```

```97835.gdsong```

```845111.gdsong```
